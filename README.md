Car crash, also known as a car accident or traffic collision, occurs when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, road debris, or any stationary object. These incidents can result in varying degrees of damage to vehicles, property, and, in severe cases, cause injuries or fatalities.
A study on the analysis of a data on car crash from the year 2003 - 2015 as the data is a bit old its understood that the use of navigation tools will be comparitively less , the emergence of navigation was in early 2000's but the popularity and updations were mainly after 2012...
The emergence of these navigation apps,road checking during seasonal changes from summer to fall , traffic reduction by using public transport during busy hours can decrease the car crashes to an extent ...
column description are given below:
year : the year of accident
month:month of accident
day : day of accident
hour : time of accident
weekend? : whether the day was weekend or not ?
collission type : how did the crash occur?
injury type : type of injury
primary factor : main reason of the crash
reported location : the place of the car crash
latitude : latitude of the crash location
longitude : longitude of the crash location

conclusions : 

- weekdays time after 3pm is more prone to accidents as the reason may be the traffic rush after office hours ,school hours etc,there are chances for the driver to be fatigue and the short distancing also
-  weekends also there are accidents but comparitively less ... weekend accidents mainly will be because of teenage drivers and the main time with more accidents is 12pm .... after long sleep people will be starting their day by this time increasing traffic rush ... the main reasons are failure to yield right of way , other driver , improper backing etc
- october was the month with more number of accidents the reasons might be more holidays , festivals like halloween etc
- fatal injuries are comparitively less but incapacitating are there for 20% , more are with very less or no injuries
- as the data is a bit old the primary factor seen as missing the deviation may be becz the use of navigation in smart fones were in the late 2000's it wont be much popular that times

inference : 

- from the above conclusions the time of accidents is at 3pm , so more traffic safety rules can be implied during that time
- october is the month with more number of accidents every year which tells us the festival season , holiday and change of weather from summer to fall increases the chances ... the roads can be checked for slippery skid and all during these month to avoid it
- failure to yield the right way also causes the main accidents reason, if a sign for turning can be kept a mile back people can check and be informative so that they can be aware
- google maps with more informations can be useful to decrease this sort of accidents
- use of public transport likes buses,metro , trams etc during busy hours can decrease the accidents
